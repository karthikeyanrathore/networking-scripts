Questions
* Why we need an OSI model?
* why we need ip address, when we have MAC address?
* How an IP address is assigned? automatically / statically (DHCP)
* Why we need subnet masking?
* why we need a router?
* Why backend applications should be in same subnet as database app?
* what is ICMP and why we need it?
* Why do firewall blocks ICMP service? is it for security reasons and how to check if it is?
* What is WebRTC, VPN, DNS? why they all use UDP?


# OSI Model
# Internet Protocol (IP)
# UDP
# TCP


-------- TCP -------- BEGIN

# TCP Overview

# TCP Segment 



# How to send message to UDP server?
```bash
python3 -c "import socket
serverAddressPort   = ('127.0.0.1', 5500)
bufferSize          = 1024
UDPClientSocket = socket.socket(family=socket.AF_INET, type=socket.SOCK_DGRAM)
UDPClientSocket.sendto(str.encode('Hi'), serverAddressPort)"
```
